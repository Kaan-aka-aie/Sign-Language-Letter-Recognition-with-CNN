# Sign Language Letter Recognition with CNN
In this notebook, a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constructed and trained on MNIST Sign Language Dataset [1] to recognize sign language letters. The dataset includes 27455 and 7172 rows for training and testing respectively. Each row stores a vector of 784 pixels that represent 784 gray scale pixels of the immage in a flattened fashion.
